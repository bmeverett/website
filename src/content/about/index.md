<h2> Hi! I'm Brandon ðŸ‘‹</h2>

I'm employed as a software engineer, but am an all around tech nerd ðŸ¤“. I grew up in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, PA and attended college at [Grove City College](http://www.gcc.edu). While there I met my wife, Emma. I convinced her to move to Pittsburgh and we've lived here ever since. We just recently had our first child and have been enjoying adjusting to our new life with her.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing keyboard on the worship team at [Riverside Community Church](https://riversideconnect.org). But I can't get away from coding too much, because I enjoy making sounds using various software instruments.

Check out my recent [Projects](/projects) to see what I've been working on.
