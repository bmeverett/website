I create my first cross-platform app written in React Native as a way to display information for my young adult ministry [The Table](http://www.thetableinbetween.org). This was my first time learning React and React Native and really kickstarted my interest in React as a whole. You can check it out on my Github [here](http://github.com/bmeverett/TheTable)
