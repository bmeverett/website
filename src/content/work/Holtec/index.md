At Holtec International, my job included working on software that helped make the day to day manufacturing processes smoother. One of my main projects was converting a Microsoft Access application written in VB.NET to a WPF application with data saved in SQL server. My other projects and responsibilities included moving all of our code and repositories from Team Foundation Server to a self hosted Gitlab server and helping with SQL database design and queries.
