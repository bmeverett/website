At Software Design Solutions, I am employed as a Software Engineer and work across many different projects for different clients in a wide range of industries. My responsibilities range from writing proposals and estimating potential projects to full architecture and system design. Working in a smaller company allows me to work with all aspects of the software stack: designing databases in SQL, writing api and backend code in C#, and writing React or just html and javascript on the frontend.
