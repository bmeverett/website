At Software Design Solutions, I was employed as a Lead Software Engineer and worked across many different projects for different clients in a wide range of industries. My responsibilities ranged from writing proposals and estimating potential projects to full architecture and system design. Working in a smaller company allowed me to work accross all aspects of the software stack: designing databases in SQL, writing api and backend code in C#, and writing React or just html and javascript on the frontend.
